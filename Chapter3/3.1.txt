I would allow stacks 1 and 3 to grow from either end of the array
stack 2 would start in the middle and grow out in both directions
the first push to stack 2 would go in the middle of the array, the second would go to the right, the third would go to the left
pop would be implemented in a similar fashion to push
push would have to check if there is room in the array to place the data where it needs to

The logic for pushing and popping for stack 2 would be more complex, but I would reason about it like this:
I would store the length of the stack 2 and use it to figure out where to place or remove the next value
for example if the length was 10, that would me that next push data would need to placed at
middle + half length of stack if length
the next push would place data in the array at middle - half length of stack
off by one errors and rounding errors might be a problem
